 * A rust library for interacting with the Google Drive v3 API.
 *
 * For more information, the Google Drive v3 API is documented at [developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * use std::env;
 *
 * use google_drive::GoogleDrive;
 * use yup_oauth2::{read_service_account_key, ServiceAccountAuthenticator};
 *
 * async fn get_drives() {
 *     // Get the GSuite credentials file.
 *     let gsuite_credential_file =
 *         env::var("GADMIN_CREDENTIAL_FILE").unwrap();
 *     let gsuite_subject = env::var("GADMIN_SUBJECT").unwrap();
 *     let gsuite_secret = read_service_account_key(gsuite_credential_file)
 *         .await
 *         .expect("failed to read gsuite credential file");
 *     let auth = ServiceAccountAuthenticator::builder(gsuite_secret)
 *         .subject(gsuite_subject.to_string())
 *         .build()
 *         .await
 *         .expect("failed to create authenticator");
 *
 *     // Add the scopes to the secret and get the token.
 *     let token = auth
 *         .token(&["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"])
 *         .await
 *         .expect("failed to get token");
 *
 *     if token.as_str().is_empty() {
 *         panic!("empty token is not valid");
 *     }
 *
 *     // Initialize the Google Drive client.
 *     let drive_client = GoogleDrive::new(token);
 *
 *     // List drives.
 *     let drives = drive_client.list_drives().await.unwrap();
 *
 *     // Iterate over the drives.
 *     for drive in drives {
